You might be wondering, "what the hell is this?" Well I am gonna answer every question you may have!

Q: What operating system does this game support? 
A: Unfortunately, since I don't wanna waste time in a real game engine, I am just making it in Apple's shortcuts app, which only runs on MacOS, iOS, IpadOS, and watchOS. I will try my best to make a windows-compatible version soon!

Q: Is this game open-source? 
A: It's on GitHub what do you expect (yes)

Q: Does this game utilize save data? 
A: Yes, it saves the customizable name for the character, inventory, etc. This is also extremely useful when updating so you don't lose any progress whatsoever.

Q: How do you update the game? 
A: Start the game, go to the settings, then press "Check for updates". It will take you to this repository where you can download the newest version. 

Q: Is this game available for offline use? 
A: Yes; it runs in the shortcuts app.
